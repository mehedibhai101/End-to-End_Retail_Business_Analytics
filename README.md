# End-to-End_Retail_Business_Analytics
In this project, I redefined Omniretail by analyzing $18.5M in revenue to fix "Profitless Growth". I diagnosed "Regional Fractures", specifically a profit bleed in the North, and a critical &lt;20% Retention Void. I engineered a loyalty framework and return-control protocols, securing the infrastructure for sustainable, data-driven expansion.
